❓ Question: What is the difference between Tier 1 and Tier 3 medications in the UHC drug list?
💬 Answer: Tier 1 medications in the UHC drug list are lower-cost medications that provide the highest overall value. They mostly consist of generic drugs, with some brand-name drugs included. These medications are used for the lowest out-of-pocket costs.

Tier 3 medications, on the other hand, are the highest-cost medications in the UHC drug list. They provide the lowest overall value and mostly consist of brand-name drugs, as well as some generics. It is recommended to ask your doctor if a Tier 1 or Tier 2 option could work for you to help reduce your out-of-pocket costs.
